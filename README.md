This homework asks the user to input relative values to questions in a survey about personal preferences. It then compares the inputed values to saved values from other users and finds the most compatible person.

The app uses bootstrap forms and javascript to request information. It saves the survey info as an object into an array and compares it to existing user object to find the closest match. Node.js and express creates the server side infrastructure and the app is hosted on heroku. We use routing systems to direct the user to the appropriate pages as well as making the correct requests or additions for data.

The homework is the first to utilize full-stack implementation. 

Missing features: 
I failed to included the logic which compares the inputed values to each object in the array and returning the person with the highest similarities.
